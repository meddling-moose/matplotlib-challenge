# matplotlib-challenge

It's not clear to me that there needs to be any written analysis for this assignment, so I willl briefly summarize my learning with pyplot and pandas plotting. 

The syntax feels very finicky. Many times I was quite close to getting the desired output, but couldn't realize it due to the nature of the error codes. I think I need to become more familiar with the error codes related to these libraries because while they tell you the line that has the error, many times its unclear what part of the line is wrong.

I got more comfortable with using .loc() which is cool. That seems like a pretty powerful function for simple filtering.

The boxplot gave me a lot of trouble, but as a result I spent a bunch of time learning about it. flierprops is a pretty interesting parameter that confused me when I was first trying to use it but now feels very easy.

One more thing, I am not sure now, having done this assignment, when to use pandas plotting vs. matplotlib plotting. They seem very similar syntactically but surely matplotlib has more features, right?

As usual all data came from the assignments starter code folder. It is not mine, I just try to make sense of it.
